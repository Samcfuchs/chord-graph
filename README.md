# Chord Chain Analysis

I aim to use the user-contributed chord progressions on [Ultimate
Guitar](https://ultimate-guitar.com) to construct a database of popular chord
progressions. Such a dataset could power a number of different tools.

## Progression Builder

Given a series of chords, a model could recommend or predict the next chord. By
combining this with existing tools which detect chords from audio samples, this
could be built into an interactive composition companion.

## Chord Visualization

Stephen Mugglin has produced a chart which visualizes connections between major
chords. This version of the chart uses scale degrees, making it key-ambivalent.
I've found it a useful tool for learning musical composition on piano.
